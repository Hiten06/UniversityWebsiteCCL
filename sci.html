Science deals with the study of the processes and occurrences that we see in the natural world around us. Scientific study is undertaken through observation and experiment. It deals with the study of facts that are verifiable. When observed facts are studied systematically it becomes a science. 
A scientific study is made possible through experiments. Experiments may be conducted in the real world or in laboratories under controlled conditions. A science allows for experiments to be conducted and results to be verified repeatedly.
 There are many different streams of sciences such as physics, chemistry, zoology, botany, geology, meteorology and astronomy.
You will find here below a number of long and short paragraphs on Science of varying word lengths. 
We hope these Science paragraphs will help students in completing their school assignments. 
These will also help children write and read out Science paragraph in simple words and with small sentences.
 Students can select any paragraph on Science according to their particular requirement.Science education is important. It helps in developing a scientific approach. 
 A scientific approach involves the systematic study of observations and facts, and their analysis and understanding by conducting experiments. 
 Scientific experiments may be conducted in the real world under real-world conditions. They may also be undertaken in laboratories under certain controlled conditions.
 Scientific research is based on scientific experiments.
A study is said to be scientific when the experiments in the subject can be conducted over and over again, and the results and theories verified repeatedly. 
This makes a scientific study objective and universal.
Scientific experimentation and study allows for technological discoveries to be made. 
Technology helps in modernization of activities and processes through various products and techniques that make life more easy and comfortable.
Commerce stream subjects

Let us take a look at some of the important subjects present in 11th and 12th standards of Science stream-

    Physics
    Chemistry
    Biology
    Geography
    Mathematics
    

Scientific and technological advancement also has a flipside to it. Products and techniques that have been generated as a consequence of scientific knowledge must be used with wisdom. For example, nuclear physics has enabled us to learn a great deal about the atom, its structure, and properties.

As a result, the nuclear reaction in the sun that makes it a ball of fire has been studied. This has advanced the frontiers of human knowledge. On the other hand, the atom bomb is also the result of the knowledge of the power of the atom. The atom bomb is a highly destructive product of scientific discovery if used. It must, therefore, not be used, as life on Planet Earth is precious and must be protected.

<p style="font-family:Lucida Calligraphy" id="kalic">The University of Bombay was established in 1857 at the Fort campus, which is located near the southern end of Mumbai island.
 It houses the administrative division of the university on a 5.3 ha (13 acres) site. It has 116,000 m2 (1.25Ã—106 sq ft) of built-up area, 2,000 m2 (22,000 sq ft) of classrooms, and 7,800 m2 (84,000 sq ft) of laboratory space. There are two post-graduate centres, 354 affiliated colleges, and 36 departments. It is built in the Gothic style and the Rajabai Clock Tower stands on the lawns of the campus.
Rajabai Clock Tower
One of Mumbai's landmarks, the Rajabai Clock Tower was completed in the 1870s and houses the University of Mumbai's library. 
Sir George Gilbert Scott modeled the Rajabai Clock Tower on the clock tower of the Palace of Westminster in London. Local businessman Premchand Roychand contributed to the cost of construction and named the tower in memory of his mother, Rajabai. 
The tower is 85 m (280 ft) tall and has five storeys. At a height of 9.1 m (30 ft) from the ground, there are eight statues representing the Indian castes. The tower clock is reported to have played 16 tunes including Rule, Britannia.[citation needed] On the initiative of the then Vice-Chancellor, Dr. Rajan Welukar, the first phase of restoration of Rajabai Clock Tower started in 2013 and was completed in May 2015. 
Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) gave a Rs 4 crore grant for this phase of the restoration project.
